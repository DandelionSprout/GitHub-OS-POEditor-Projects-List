# What is this?

This repository, "__[GitHub OS POEditor Projects List](https://github.com/Maikuolan/GitHub-OS-POEditor-Projects-List)__", is intended to act as a list of GitHub open source projects on __[POEditor](https://poeditor.com/)__ looking for translators.

# The list:

(You can copy/paste rows and change as necessary if not sure what to write).

[Clipboard Actions](https://github.com/joecks/clipboard-actions-community) | [Clipboard Actions](https://poeditor.com/join/project/QJknOiXAF2) | English | Clipboard Actions creates actions based on your clipboard and shows them in the status bar as notifications. | If you are participating in the translation program you are providing translations under CC-By or CC 0 (Open Domain) Licence. If not further stated CC-By will be assumed and your name will be mentioned in the translation notes.

### Contributing:

If you wish to contribute, fork the project, make whatever changes you want to make, and send a pull request.

- Dead projects or projects no longer seeking assisting with translations should be removed from the list.
- Listings should all be open source and should fit with the purpose of this list (because if the listings don't fit with the purpose of this list, the list risks becoming too vague and generalised, and thus, less useful).
- Any information added should be clear, concise and intelligible.
- Restrictions and barriers should otherwise be minimal.

### Licensing:

Because this repository contains only a list (a list which, if there is any interest in it, will likely be contributed to by multiple GitHub users, will likely frequently change and should only serve as a point of reference to other repositories or projects, which will, of course, all have their own licensing schema unrelated to this particular repository), and because this repository contains no actual working code for any project or projects, I feel that licensing restrictions would be rather unnecessary and counterproductive, and so, to this repository, I opt to apply the "Unlicense" license (*see [LICENSE](https://github.com/Maikuolan/GitHub-OS-POEditor-Projects-List/blob/master/LICENSE)*).
