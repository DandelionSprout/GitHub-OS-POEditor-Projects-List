# What is this?

This repository, "__[GitHub OS POEditor Projects List](https://github.com/Maikuolan/GitHub-OS-POEditor-Projects-List)__", is intended to act as a list of GitHub open source projects on __[POEditor](https://poeditor.com/)__ looking for translators.

This isn't yet a mature project (I've only just thought of the idea to create this repository earlier today [2016.01.29]), and I'm still in the process of gauging whether there's likely to be any interest in a list such as this from others, so, whether this repository will be developed further or simply deleted in the near future, time will tell (it's my hope a list like this will be useful for others, but, if it isn't useful, there'll be little or no point in developing it further).

## Why create this repository?

There are several projects I'm involved with here on GitHub, where translations have been or are being sought after, but progress in finding willing translators for these projects has usually been very slow, and so, in the hopes of expediting this process, eventually, I registered these projects with POEditor; My rationale in this decision is that not all translators are necessarily going to be programmers, just as not all programmers are necessarily going to be translators, and thus, having a way to separate these two things (programming versus translating) could potentially assist with preventing translators like these from becoming disinterested in these projects, if they happen to find them, happen to have interest in them but don't want to work directly with code or with GitHub (there are options available, of course, for bridging the divide between code and external service, if anyone wished to use these options, or, alternatively, when translation work is completed, the coder could always manually copy those translations back to whatever format they deemed necessary). I tried a handful of different solutions prior to POEditor, all of which I found to be lacking in some way or another, or which had faulty interfaces or similar such problems, or which I simply didn't like using, but POEditor, to me, feels like a simple, straightforward, easy to use and very efficient interface, and I haven't had the same problems with POEditor that I've had with these other solutions I'd tried prior to it (and before anyone asks, no, I'm not going to mention what these other solutions are that I'd rejected, because doing so would detract from the purpose of this repository).

Since doing so, I've wondered if there was perhaps some collective list available for listing projects such as these, after registering them with POEditor, specifically to let others know about them, and that they were in need of translators and/or collaborators, and so, to answer this question, I ran a few quick searches using the GitHub search functionality (searching for related keywords, such as "i18n", "i10n", "POEditor", "help wanted", "list", etc), but these searches all turned up nothing of the likes (well, unsurprisingly, these searches turned up a large number of projects/repositories by various authors/programmers, all in the same situation, all looking for help with translations, but, they didn't specifically turn up any lists like this). Seeing no such similar list list by searching, I figured that the best course of action would be to create one, and so, here we are: At the "GitHub OS POEditor Projects List", a list of GitHub opensource projects on POEditor looking for translators.

..Of course, if I've simply missed it, and if there is, in fact, such a list already out there, feel free to point me in its direction, and I'll defer to that.

### Contributing:

I intend to include a "CONTRIBUTING.md" in the near future, but for now, if you wish to contribute, simply fork the project, make whatever changes you want to make, and send a pull request: If there's no problems with the changes, I'll most likely approve them.

- Dead projects or projects no longer seeking assisting with translations should be removed from the list.
- Listings should all be open source and should fit with the purpose of this list (because if the listings don't fit with the purpose of this list, the list risks becoming too vague and generalised, and thus, less useful).
- Any information added should be clear, concise and intelligible.
- Restrictions and barriers should otherwise be minimal.

### Licensing:

Because this repository contains only a list (a list which, if there is any interest in it, will likely be contributed to by multiple GitHub users, will likely frequently change and should only serve as a point of reference to other repositories or projects, which will, of course, all have their own licensing schema unrelated to this particular repository), and because this repository contains no actual working code for any project or projects, I feel that licensing restrictions would be rather unnecessary and counterproductive, and so, to this repository, I opt to apply the "Unlicense" license (*see [LICENSE](https://github.com/Maikuolan/GitHub-OS-POEditor-Projects-List/blob/master/LICENSE)*).
